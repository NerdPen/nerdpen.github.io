                                    7.1 In accordance with Clause 2.1 of this Policy, you have the right to:
                                    <br /><br />
                                    a) check whether the True Group holds any Personal Data relating to you and, if so, obtain copies of such data;
                                    and
                                    <br />
                                    b) require the True Group to correct any Personal Data relating to you which is inaccurate for the purpose for
                                    which it is being used.
                                </p>

                                    7.2 The True Group reserves the right to charge a reasonable administrative fee in order to meet your requests
                                    under Clause 7.1. Upon payment of the requisite fee, your request shall be processed within a reasonable time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    7.3 If you wish to verify the details you have submitted to the True Group or if you wish to check on the manner
                                    in which True Group uses and processes your personal data, the True Group’s security procedures mean that the True
                                    Group may request proof of identity before we reveal information. This proof of identity will take the form of
                                    full details of name, membership number and NRIC or Passport or Fin number. You must therefore keep this
                                    information safe as you will be responsible for any action which the True Group takes in response to a request
                                    from someone using your membership details. We would strongly recommend that you do not use the browser’s password
                                    memory function as that would permit other people using your terminal to access your personal information.
